# omni — Project Memory

## Context Protocol
- This Registry acts as the Single Source of Truth (SSoT) for the omni project codebase.
- ONLY the Orchestrator (via dispatched subagents) reads and modifies `runtime/` updates.
- Agents receive documents via `context_map.json` injection — they do not browse the registry directly.

## SSoT Routing (Obsidian Vault)

### The Static Blueprint (Immutable during sprints)
These folders dictate HOW the system works and WHAT it is supposed to be. Agents treat these as read-only during sprints.

- **Architecture design**: `blueprint/design/architecture_overview.md`
- **Design principles**: `blueprint/design/design_principles.md`
- **API / data contracts**: `blueprint/design/api_mapping.md`
- **Engineering workflow**: `blueprint/engineering/dev_workflow.md`
- **Testing strategy**: `blueprint/engineering/testing_strategy.md`
- **Performance goals**: `blueprint/engineering/performance_goals.md`
- **Agent role definitions**: `blueprint/orchestrate-members/`
- **Hook specifications**: `blueprint/hooks/`
- **Phase roadmap**: `blueprint/planning/roadmap.md`
- **Context Protocol map**: `context_map.json`

### The Dynamic State (Runtime)
These folders track live execution, progress, bugs, and active context. Updated by dispatched subagents during sprints.

- **Active Sprints** (orchestrator-only): `runtime/active_sprint.md`
- **Milestones**: `runtime/milestones.md`
- **Backlog**: `runtime/backlog.md`
- **OpenSpec Index**: `runtime/openspec/index.md`
- **Active Features**: `runtime/openspec/changes/`
- **Completed Features**: `runtime/openspec/archive/`
- **Implementation Records (IRs)**: `runtime/implementation/` → Indexed in `IR_INDEX.md`
- **Resolved bugs log**: `runtime/resolved_bugs.md`
- **Research (Scratchpad)**: `runtime/research/`

## Definitions
- **Sprint**: One feature's complete lifecycle through the spec cascade (proposal → merge). NOT the industry-standard time-boxed sprint.
- **Milestone**: A collection of completed sprints that achieve a larger goal (grand vision checkpoint).
